<h1>Privacy policy for the mobile application BikeSharingHub</h1>
<p>
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application BikeSharingHub (the "Application") for mobile devices that is maintained by Fran&ccedil;ois FERREIRA DE SOUSA and contributors ("Us").
</p>
<p>
The Application displays data about "bikesharing networks". A bikesharing network means a set of stations located in a specific city or area, where self-service bicycles can be rented through a subscription to a given operator. We are not affiliated to any of these operators, all data is obtained freely.
</p>

<h2>1. What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

<h3>1.1. User location</h3>

<p>
During the installation or usage of the Application, you <strong>must</strong> decide to grant or deny access to your location. When granted, the Application offers the following features :
<ul>
<li>Filter the display of nearby stations</li>
<li>Display your location on a map</li>
</ul>
To perform these features, your location is processed only on your device. It is not collected by Us, neither transmited to any third party.
</p>

<h3>1.2. List of favorites stations</h3>

<p>
During the usage of the Application you <strong>may</strong> mark some stations as favorites. A given station might be associated to its location.
</p>
<p>
This list of stations and their location is stored only on your device memory. It is not collected by Us neither transmited to any thirdparty.
</p>

<h3>1.3. List of bikesharing networks</h3>

<p>
During the first launch of the Application, you <strong>must</strong> select the list of bikesharing networks that you want to monitor. From then on, the Application sends regularly a request with the content of this list to a third-party ("The API server") in order to refresh data related to them.
</p>
<p>
The API server could be either one you provided yourself, or the default one which is a free to use server hosted at <a href="https://citybik.es">https://citybik.es</a> (no privacy policy found). Please note that We provide only the Application and We are not affiliated to The API server you will use. We don't send intentionaly any personal data to it but you are informed that, technically The API server <strong>can</strong> see your IP address.
</p>

<h3>1.4. Browsed map areas</h3>

<p>
During the usage of the Application you <strong>may</strong> use a feature which displays on a map the station's location, and eventually your own location. The map imagery is not embedded in the Application. As you browse the map, the corresponding image is downloaded from a third-party server ("The tile provider").
</p>
<p>
The tile provider is one of the following (depending on your Application's settings) :
<ul>
<li>"Mapnik" operated by "OpenStreetMap fondation" (privacy policy available at <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy">https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy</a>)</li>
<li>"&Ouml;PNKarte" operated by "Memomaps" (privacy policy available at : <a href="https://www.xn--pnvkarte-m4a.de">https://www.xn--pnvkarte-m4a.de</a>)</li>
<li>"CyclOSM" operated by "OpenStreetMap France" (no privacy policy found)</li>
</ul>
Please note that We provide only the Application and We are not affiliated to any tile provider. We don't send intentionaly any personal data to them, but you are informed that, technically the Tile provider <strong>can</strong> see your IP address and the location area you have downloaded.
</p>
